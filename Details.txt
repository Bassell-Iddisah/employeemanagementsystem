Simple Employee Management System


	Main Tasks:
1. Implement Comparable <Employee<T>> to sort employees by years of experience (descending order).

	Functions:
Add
Manage
Search
Filter
Sort.

2. Implement the employee Database (Using Collections & CRUD operations). Use HashMap<T, Employee<T>> to store employees (employeeid as the key, Employee object as value)

	Functions:
Create: addEmployee(Employee<T> employee)
Read: getAllEmployees()
Update: updateEmployeeDetails(T employeeId, String field, Object newValue)
Delete: removeEmployee(T employeeId)

3. Searching & filtering Employees (Streams & Iterators). Methods to search for employees by:

	Methods:
Department: Get all employees in each department.
Name: Get employees whose name contains a search term.
Minimum performance rating: Rating >= 4.0.
Employees within minimum salary range: Eg>: between $50,000 - $100,000 [Stream API for filtering operations.]
Iterator to traverse and display all employees.

4. Sorting Employees (Comparable & Comparator)
Implement sorting using:
a. Comparable<Employee<T>> (Sort employees by years of experience, most experienced first).
b. Comparator<Employee<T>> for custom serting: {
    EmployeeSalarayComparator: Sorts employees by higher salary first.
    EmployeePerformanceComparator: Sorts employees by best performance first.
}

5. Salary Management (Collections & Streams)
Implement methods to:
	a. Salary raise to employees with rating >= 4.5
	b. Get top 5 highest-paid employees.
	c. Average salary of employees in a department. [Lists & Streams for efficient salary processing and analytics]

6. Display Employees (For-Each & Streams)
Implement a structured way to display employees:
	a. for-each loop to print employee details
	b. Stream API to generate formatted reports.
	c. Clean, well-formatted console output[alignments, spacing]

7. Simple JavaFX User Interface
Simple GUI for managing employees
	Features:
Employee List Display
